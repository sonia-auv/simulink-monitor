```bash
    git clone git@github.com:sonia-auv/simulink-monitor.git
```

### Prerequisites

First and foremost to run the module you will need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=getstarted&utm_content=sitelink&utm_term=getstarted&utm_budget=growth&gclid=CjwKCAjw57b3BRBlEiwA1Imytuv9VRFX5Z0INBaD3JJNSUmadgQh7ZYWTw_r-yFn2S4XjZTsLbNnnBoCPsIQAvD_BwE) installed.

To validate your installation of docker, simply type in
